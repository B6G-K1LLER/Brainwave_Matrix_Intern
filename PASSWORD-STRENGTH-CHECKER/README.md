PassSafeCheck Password Strength Checker
PassSafeCheck is a robust tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on key security metrics such as length, complexity, and uniqueness. It provides detailed feedback and a color-coded assessment to help users create strong and secure passwords.

Features
Length Analysis: Ensures that passwords meet a minimum length of 8 characters, with recommendations for optimal security (12+ characters).
Uppercase Check: Encourages the inclusion of uppercase letters to enhance complexity.
Lowercase Check: Verifies the use of lowercase letters for balanced character diversity.
Digit Inclusion: Identifies the presence of numeric characters to strengthen password resilience.
Special Characters: Detects special symbols like !@#$%^&* to improve password unpredictability.
Uniqueness Evaluation: Flags repetitive or predictable patterns, ensuring higher entropy.
⚠️ Notice: This tool provides guidance on password strength but does not guarantee absolute security. Always follow best practices for password management, including using unique passwords for each service and considering a password manager.
